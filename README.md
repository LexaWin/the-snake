# the-snake

It's my implementaion of the Snake game.

The rules is very simle. The Snake moves through game field. You can change its direction so that the Snake moves towards the food.

When the Snake eats the food, it grows and starts moving a bit faster.

One can go beyond the playing field edge. The snake will appear from the opposite side.

There is only one constraint. Don't let the snake crash into itself.

Good luck!
